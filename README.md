# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict forest cover types based on terrain and environmental features from the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: UCI ML Repository
- Features: Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Soil Type, Hillshade, Distances to water/fire/roads, etc.
- Target: `Cover_Type` (1-7 categories)

## 📊 Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: 88%
- Best Features: Elevation, Distance to Roads/Fire Points/Hydrology
